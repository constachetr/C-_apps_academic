### **📌 Project Overview**
This project is a **C# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) simulation of a vending machine** that allows users to:
- Purchase **food and drinks**.
- Pay using **cash or card**.
- Track total **cash & card turnover**.
- Provide **admin access** for managing cash withdrawals.
- Implement **secure access control for shutting down the machine**.

It demonstrates **solid OOP principles**, **error handling**, and **user-friendly interactions**, making it an **ideal project for C# developers** looking to showcase **clean and structured code**.

---

## **🛠 Features**
✅ **Food & Drinks Menu** - Users can buy various items like burgers, sandwiches, cola, and water.  
✅ **Payment System** - Supports **card payments** and **cash payments with change calculation**.  
✅ **Turnover Tracking** - Separates **card and cash earnings**, displaying total revenue.  
✅ **Admin Access & Security** - Allows admins to **withdraw cash** and **shut down the machine with a password**.  
✅ **User-Friendly CLI Interface** - Interactive menu-driven interface with **clear instructions and feedback**.  
✅ **Error Handling & Input Validation** - Prevents invalid inputs and **ensures robust program execution**.

## **💻 Technologies Used**
- **C#** (Main Programming Language)
- **.NET Framework** (Console Application)
- **OOP Concepts** (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Classes, and Objects)
- **Data Structures** (Dictionary for product prices, numeric validation for transactions)

---

## **🚀 How It Works**
### **1️⃣ User Interface**
The vending machine presents a **menu-driven system** where users can:
- Select **food or drinks**.
- Choose **payment methods**.
- View **real-time feedback** on purchases.

### **2️⃣ Payment System**
- **Card Payment:** User enters `"card"`, and the system confirms the payment.  
- **Cash Payment:** User enters the amount, and the system **calculates change** or rejects insufficient cash.

### **3️⃣ Admin Privileges**
- Admins **enter a secure password** (`admin123`) to access **turnover and cash-out options**.
- Admins can **withdraw cash**, and the **remaining balance updates dynamically**.

### **4️⃣ Secure Shutdown**
- Only **authorized admins** with the password (`exit123`) can **shut down the vending machine**.

## **🏆 Why This Project Stands Out**
💡 **Practical Use Case** – This project is **a real-world simulation** of vending machine functionality.  
📌 **OOP Principles in Action** – Implements **encapsulation, abstraction, and object interactions**.  
🛠 **Error Handling** – Prevents **invalid inputs, handles transactions securely, and ensures smooth execution**.  
🔒 **Security Features** – Uses **password authentication** for administrative access and system shutdown.  
📊 **Data Management** – Utilizes **dictionary storage** for dynamic product pricing and **numeric tracking for cash flow**.
